            <p>I had an interesting time both in my elementary and high school life. I developed so many skills like communication skills, problem solving skills, etc. When I was in elementary school I participated in a different association which helped me to develop my communication skills with people around me. It also helped me to enhance my ability to identify the problem and solve the problem. Indeed while I was in high school I took part in various school communities which perform different activities that are important for the community around our school.</p>
            <p>I attend my elementary and high school in different schools in our villages. Due to that I could get a chance to meet so many friends and enhance my ability to adapt to a new environment quickly. The below table describes my different level education schools and some information about class and how many years I stayed in one school.</p>
