        <h1>About me</h1>
        <div class = "main main--detail">
            <p>As I tried to briefly explain myself above, my name  is Naol Aklilu. I'm a third year software engineering student at Addis ababa institute of technology. I am really happy for being a student of this big and hub of a lot of well experienced professional institutions.  </p>
            <p>Personally, I like to discover new things and try to solve different problems I come across during my life. So I got chances to learn new things and find solutions for the existing problem. For different challenges I got on my journey I tried to solve them with a cool mind and take them as experience for the future.</p>
            <p>I believe that hard work is the key for success and development. I worked hard both on my studies and on my social life. The reason why I joined software engineering is because I know that this field of study brought me various opportunities through which I can develop so many products which solve different problems in my society and transform the technology stages of our country and our continent some steps forward.</p> 
            <p>Since I started to study this field I have acquired so many skills and knowledge. You can get those skills on the My Skill pages by clicking the below My Skill button. To know about my educational background use the below My educational Background link.</p>
            <p>Apart from academics, I play football, fictional reading books, hang out with my friends, etc. My favorite football players are: </p>
